## Templates
There are some base templates here. Generally the _boilerplates directory shouldn't need to be modified on a per-project basis.

## Style guide
1. Files and directories should be in kebab-case (all lowercase separated by hyphens).
2. When including twig files in a template, drop the .twig extension. This allows us to easily specify a file or a directory by having an index.twig in said directory.
